            <summary>
            Base abstract class for all endpoint addresses which defines the common behaviour.
            All the classes that derived trom this class are used in the <see cref="T:TransMock.EndpointsMock`1"/> class' 
            Setup methods in conjunction with the concreate TAddresses implementation to scope setting up only allowed
            addresses for the given messaging pattern. The concrete TAddresses class is an instance of a class MockAddresses
            class generated by the mockfier.
            For instance in the case of SetupReceive method there can only be specivied properties from the MockAddresses* class
            that are of type ReceiveEndpointAddress. This way the programing model is becoming in a way strongly typed in terms of the 
            address definitions for the mocked endpoints and hence any errors that were previously encountered based on wrongly pointing
            to incompatible mocked endpoint are now history.

            <summary>
            This class represents a mock of a service/integration implementation from its endpoints point of view and it is set up once for a test suite.
            This is because a service/integration flow has a finite and predictable set of receive and send endpoints.
            What varies during execution is the messages received over/sent to a given endpoint instance.
            This behavior is driven by the <see cref="T:TransMock.TestMessagingClient`1"/> class from where the corresponding messaging operations are performed.
            This is why the Setup methods match the direction of the message flow, e.g. SetupReceive is setting up a receive
            endpoint and vice versa.
