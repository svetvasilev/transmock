TransMock allows you to easily test your BizTalk integrations in an end-to-end manner. 
It does so by introducing a set of custom BizUnit test steps, which when executed from a test case, 
communicate with an integration through the TransMock adapter.

The following BizTalk Server versions are supported:
- 2010/2013/2013 R2/2016

NB: Please note that for each version update the btdfproj file has to be updated in the part where the reference to the TransMock.targets file is defined!
    Example: v1.3.5 reference is:      <Import Project="$(MSBuildProjectDirectory)\..\packages\TransMock.Framework.1.3.3\BTDF\TransMock.targets" />
	         v1.4.0 reference will be: <Import Project="$(MSBuildProjectDirectory)\..\packages\TransMock.Framework.1.4.0\BTDF\TransMock.targets" />
